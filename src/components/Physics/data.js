      description: `<p>My earliest simulation, the one where it all began. I just knew that simple harmonic motion would be fun to look at animated, so I made a simulation where I could easily tinker with the variables and see the formulas.</p>`

      description: `<p>When I first studied them, the workings of a diode and their "depletion region" confused me. Given how essential they are for computing, I wanted to understand them better. Making this simulation helped.</p>`
